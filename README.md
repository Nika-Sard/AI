## Homework 1

### Introduction
In this homework, we implement general search algorithms and apply them to help Pacman navigate through mazes efficiently, collect food, and solve various problems.

### Key Features
1. **Search Algorithms**:
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
   - A* Search

2. **Custom Problem Solving**:
   - Navigating to fixed food dots.
   - Finding the shortest path through corner mazes.
   - Exploring varying cost functions for paths.

3. **Heuristic Design**:
   - Custom heuristics for A* search to optimize problem-solving.

## Homework 2

### Introduction
In this project, we design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including the ghosts. We implement both minimax and expectimax search algorithms and explore the design of evaluation functions.

### Key Features
1. **Search Algorithms**:
   - Minimax Search
   - Alpha-Beta Pruning
   - Expectimax Search

2. **Adversarial Agent Design**:
   - Implementing the Minimax agent to handle multiple ghosts and varying depths.
   - Optimizing the search with Alpha-Beta pruning to speed up minimax search.
   - Exploring probabilistic behavior with Expectimax to model random ghost actions.

3. **Evaluation Function**:
   - Writing a better evaluation function to improve agent performance, focusing on state evaluation rather than action evaluation.
